In Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (5e), combat is structured in a sequence of rounds, with each round being broken down into several key stages and actions. Here are the **standard stages** of combat in 5e:

### 1. **Initiative**
   - **Initiative Roll**: At the beginning of combat, every participant (player characters, NPCs, and monsters) rolls an initiative check to determine the order in which they act. Initiative is a Dexterity check, and the highest result acts first, followed by others in descending order.
   
### 2. **Combat Round**
   A **round** represents 6 seconds in the game world, and every participant gets one turn during a round. A round continues until all participants have taken a turn, then the next round begins. A round consists of:

### 3. **Turn**
   On each participant's turn, they can perform a series of actions. The main elements of a turn are:

   1. **Movement**:
      - On their turn, a creature can move up to their speed (measured in feet). Movement can occur before or after taking an action, or even split up.
   
   2. **Action**:
      - Each creature can take **one action** per turn, chosen from several options:
        - **Attack**: Make a melee or ranged attack.
        - **Cast a Spell**: Cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action.
        - **Dash**: Double your movement speed for the turn.
        - **Disengage**: Avoid provoking opportunity attacks when moving.
        - **Dodge**: Gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws and impose disadvantage on attacks made against you.
        - **Help**: Aid an ally with an ability check or attack roll.
        - **Hide**: Attempt to hide.
        - **Ready**: Ready an action to occur in response to a specified trigger.
        - **Search**: Look for something (such as a hidden door or an enemy).
        - **Use an Object**: Interact with an object.

   3. **Bonus Action**:
      - Certain abilities, spells, and features allow a creature to take an additional action called a **bonus action** on their turn. A creature can only take one bonus action per turn.

   4. **Reaction**:
      - A reaction is an instantaneous action that a creature can take in response to a specific trigger, even when it’s not their turn. Each creature gets **one reaction per round**.
      - Examples of reactions include:
        - **Opportunity Attack**: When an enemy leaves a creature’s reach.
        - **Casting a Spell**: Certain spells, like *Counterspell*, can be cast as a reaction.

   5. **Free Interaction**:
      - A character can interact with one object or feature of the environment for free during their movement or action (e.g., drawing a weapon, opening a door).

### 4. **End of Turn**
   At the end of a turn, the following may occur:
   - **End Effects**: Conditions or effects with durations that last until the end of a turn (e.g., *Haste*) may expire or activate.
   - **Saving Throws**: Some conditions, like being stunned or paralyzed, may allow the creature to make a saving throw to remove the condition at the end of their turn.

### 5. **Start of the Next Round**
   After every participant has taken a turn, the next round begins. Combat continues in this cyclical manner until one side achieves victory, flees, or surrenders.

### Optional Actions (often added by Dungeon Masters):
   - **Legendary Actions**: Certain powerful creatures, like dragons, can take legendary actions at the end of another creature’s turn. These are extra actions that don’t count against the creature’s normal actions.

### Summary of Key Stages in Combat:
1. **Initiative**: Determine turn order.
2. **Combat Rounds**: One full round where each participant takes a turn.
3. **Turn Structure**:
   - Movement
   - Action (Attack, Cast a Spell, etc.)
   - Bonus Action (if applicable)
   - Reaction (when triggered)
   - Free Object Interaction
4. **End of Turn**: Apply any conditions or effects.
5. **Next Round**: Repeat the cycle until combat ends.

Each turn represents a tactical opportunity, and players must choose how to best use their movement, action, bonus action, and reaction during combat.
