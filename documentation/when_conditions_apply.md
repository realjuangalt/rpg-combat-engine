In Dungeons & Dragons 5e, conditions are statuses that affect creatures in specific ways, altering their abilities, actions, or defenses during combat. These conditions can be applied at various stages of combat depending on the circumstances, and they interact with the game’s mechanics throughout the stages you described.

### 14 Base Conditions in 5e:
1. **Blinded**
2. **Charmed**
3. **Deafened**
4. **Frightened**
5. **Grappled**
6. **Incapacitated**
7. **Invisible**
8. **Paralyzed**
9. **Petrified**
10. **Poisoned**
11. **Prone**
12. **Restrained**
13. **Stunned**
14. **Unconscious**

### Stages of Combat and When Conditions Apply:

1. **Start of Combat (Surprise)**
   - **Conditions like** *Surprised* (not an official 5e condition but treated as one) can affect the creature's actions during the first round. Surprised creatures cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions on their first turn.

2. **Initiative**
   - **No specific conditions** are directly tied to this stage. However, certain conditions (like *Stunned*, *Incapacitated*, or *Unconscious*) could affect whether a creature can react quickly or take its turn when combat begins, as they may not be able to participate in initiative effectively.

3. **Taking Turns**
   - **Conditions during actions**:
     - **Blinded**: Impacts attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight.
     - **Charmed**: Prevents a creature from attacking the charmer.
     - **Deafened**: Affects ability checks related to hearing.
     - **Frightened**: Disadvantage on attacks and ability checks while the source of fear is in line of sight.
     - **Grappled**: Reduces movement to 0.
     - **Incapacitated**: Prevents taking actions or reactions.
     - **Invisible**: Provides advantage on attacks and makes attacks against the creature more difficult (disadvantage).
     - **Paralyzed**: Incapacitates a creature and makes them vulnerable to melee critical hits within 5 feet.
     - **Petrified**: Essentially removes the creature from combat (incapacitated, can't move, immune to certain damage types).
     - **Poisoned**: Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
     - **Prone**: Disadvantage on attack rolls (ranged), and only crawl movement is allowed.
     - **Restrained**: Disadvantage on attack rolls, and speed reduced to 0.
     - **Stunned**: Incapacitated, can’t move, and speaks falteringly.
     - **Unconscious**: Incapacitated, prone, unaware of surroundings, and vulnerable to critical hits from attackers within 5 feet.
   - **Reactions**: Some conditions (like *Incapacitated*, *Stunned*, *Paralyzed*) prevent reactions. For example, *Grappled* or *Restrained* might allow an opportunity attack when the creature moves out of range.

4. **Resolving Actions**
   - **Conditions during attack and damage rolls**:
     - **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Conditions like *Blinded*, *Invisible*, *Restrained*, *Stunned*, *Paralyzed*, and *Unconscious* impact attack rolls by providing advantage or disadvantage.
     - **Critical Hits**: *Paralyzed* and *Unconscious* creatures are particularly vulnerable to melee critical hits from attackers within 5 feet.
     - **Damage Resistance or Immunity**: Some conditions like *Petrified* provide damage resistance or immunity to certain types of damage.

5. **End of Turn**
   - **Condition Duration and Removal**:
     - Many conditions (like *Blinded*, *Frightened*, *Poisoned*, *Grappled*, etc.) can have durations based on rounds or end at the end of a creature's turn.
     - Some conditions may require a saving throw at the end of a turn to remove (like *Paralyzed* or *Frightened*), while others may be removed through external actions (like healing *Unconscious* or escaping *Grappled*).
     - Concentration-based conditions like *Charmed* can end if concentration is broken.

6. **Ending Combat**
   - **Persistent Conditions**: Certain conditions like *Petrified* or *Unconscious* (if the character isn't revived) may persist beyond combat, requiring non-combat actions to resolve.
   - **Condition Expiration**: At the end of combat, some conditions (like *Frightened* or *Prone*) may naturally expire or be resolved based on the outcome of combat.

### Summary:
- **Conditions mainly affect stages 3 and 4**: They heavily influence how turns are taken, what actions can be performed, and how actions are resolved.
- **Conditions apply dynamically throughout combat**: Conditions like *Blinded*, *Paralyzed*, or *Restrained* can dramatically affect a creature’s effectiveness during their turn and while taking damage.
- **Durations and removal of conditions** come into play most often at the **end of the turn**, but some can persist or be removed through special actions, saving throws, or external influences.
