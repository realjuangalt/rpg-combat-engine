The combat engine you've developed is quite advanced and covers many essential aspects of D&D 5e combat dynamics, but to fully align with the core rules and provide a richer experience, a few more features and refinements could be considered:

### 1. **Action Economy:**
   - **Bonus Actions:** Some actions and spells are classified as bonus actions, allowing a character to perform them in addition to their main action. Implementing bonus actions would involve allowing characters to take an extra action during their turn if applicable.
   - **Reactions:** Reactions occur in response to certain triggers, like an opportunity attack when an enemy leaves a character's reach. Implementing reactions would require tracking potential triggers during other characters' turns.

### 2. **Damage Types and Resistances:**
   - Different attacks and spells can have various damage types (e.g., fire, cold, piercing). Characters and monsters can have resistances, vulnerabilities, or immunities to specific types of damage, influencing the amount of damage taken.

### 3. **Conditions:**
   - Conditions like being stunned, blinded, or frightened can significantly affect combat. Implementing these conditions would involve modifying characters' abilities or restricting their actions based on their current condition.

### 4. **Spell Slots and Resource Management:**
   - Implementing a system for managing spell slots, so characters can only cast a limited number of spells before needing to rest. Similarly, other resources like hit dice for healing or items with limited uses (e.g., potions) could be tracked.

### 5. **Complex Multi-targeting Spells:**
   - Spells like *Fireball* might affect multiple targets in an area of effect (AOE). While you've begun implementing this, handling various AOE shapes and calculating who gets hit would be an improvement.

### 6. **Saving Throw Effects:**
   - Some spells may apply effects (like paralysis or fear) if a saving throw is failed. Handling these additional effects would require extending the `cast_spell` logic.

### 7. **Character Status Effects:**
   - Implementing status effects (e.g., poisoned, stunned) that impact a character's abilities or impose disadvantages on rolls. These effects would need to be applied and checked on each turn.

### 8. **Rest and Recovery Mechanics:**
   - Incorporating long and short rest mechanics for recovering hit points, spells, and other abilities. This would allow for a more extended play session beyond a single encounter.

### 9. **Initiative Modifiers and Tiebreakers:**
   - D&D 5e has specific rules for handling ties in initiative rolls, often based on Dexterity or by rolling again. Implementing tiebreakers would add another layer of accuracy.

### 10. **Advanced Targeting and Range Management:**
   - Consideration for the range of spells and weapons and line of sight could be added. Characters should only be able to target others within their effective range, and obstacles might block line-of-sight attacks.

### 11. **Experience and Leveling Up:**
   - Implementing a system to track experience points (XP) and level up characters after encounters would add to the long-term progression of the game.

### 12. **Equipment Management:**
   - More advanced equipment management, including armor that changes AC based on the type of attack, or items that provide passive bonuses or penalties.

### 13. **Battlefield Effects:**
   - Environmental factors, such as difficult terrain, cover, or hazards like traps or pits, could influence movement and combat.

### 14. **Turn Order Display:**
   - Showing the full turn order at the beginning of each round can help players strategize better.

### 15. **Critical Successes and Failures Beyond Combat:**
   - Implementing additional rules for critical successes and failures, especially for skill checks or saving throws.
   - (DONE) combat implementation

### 16. **Finesse Weapons and Versatile Damage:**
   - (DONE) Handling finesse weapons properly, allowing characters to use Dexterity instead of Strength for attacks, and managing versatile damage (e.g., a weapon doing different damage based on how itâ€™s wielded).

### 17. **Non-combat Interactions:**
   - Integrating role-playing and exploration mechanics like dialogue, investigation, and traps to create a more holistic D&D experience.

These features would bring the combat system much closer to the full D&D 5e experience. Some of these additions, like implementing conditions or a more complex spell system, could be significant undertakings. However, even just a few of these enhancements could add depth and variety to the combat encounters.
